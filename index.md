## Welcome to My World!

---

I'm Masazumi Imai, a Ph.D. student at [Space Robotics Lab (SRL)](https://astro2.mech.tohoku.ac.jp/en/) at Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan.

My research focuses on space robotics, specifically targeting multi-limbed articulated systems for lunar/planetary exploration and on-orbit missions.
Key areas of my work include dynamics, motion planning, compliant control, and Model Predictive Control (MPC) applied to limbed climbing robots for traversing rough terrain and assisting astronauts on space stations.
